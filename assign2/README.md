# CS433 Programming Assignment 2

In this assignment, you will write a simple UNIX shell that accepts user commands and then executes each command in a separate process. It is based on programming
project 1 in chapter 3 of the textbook. A starter skeleton program 
"prog.cpp" and Makefile are provided. Type `make` to build the executable `prog2`, and type `./prog2` to run it. 


Read on the course website for more details and submission instructions. Complete all the required features and remove "TODO"s from the source code. It's OK to add 
additional helper functions but don't change the file name.
